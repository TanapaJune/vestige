//! FSRS-6 (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) Module
//!
//! The state-of-the-art spaced repetition algorithm (2025-2026).
//! 20-30% more efficient than SM-2 (Anki's original algorithm).
//!
//! Reference: https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki
//!
//! ## Key improvements in FSRS-6 over FSRS-5:
//! - 21 parameters (vs 19) with personalizable forgetting curve decay (w20)
//! - Same-day review handling with S^(-w19) term
//! - Better short-term memory modeling
//!
//! ## Core Formulas:
//! - Retrievability: R = (1 + FACTOR * t / S)^(-w20) where FACTOR = 0.9^(-1/w20) - 1
//! - Interval: t = S/FACTOR * (R^(1/w20) - 1)

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- FSRS-6 spaced repetition algorithm with 21 parameters
- Bjork & Bjork dual-strength memory model (storage + retrieval strength)
- Local semantic embeddings with fastembed v5 (BGE-base-en-v1.5, 768 dimensions)
- HNSW vector search with USearch (20x faster than FAISS)
- Hybrid search combining BM25 keyword + semantic + RRF fusion
- Two-stage retrieval with reranking (+15-20% precision)
- MCP server for Claude Desktop integration
- Tauri desktop application
- Codebase memory module for AI code understanding
- Neuroscience-inspired memory mechanisms:
  - Synaptic Tagging and Capture (retroactive importance)
  - Context-Dependent Memory (Tulving encoding specificity)
  - Spreading Activation Networks
  - Memory States (Active/Dormant/Silent/Unavailable)
  - Multi-channel Importance Signals (Novelty/Arousal/Reward/Attention)
  - Hippocampal Indexing (Teyler & Rudy 2007)
